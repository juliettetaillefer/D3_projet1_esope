        <h1> The Fox and the Stork</h1>
        <p class="intro">The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork, at whose odd appearance he was always laughing.
          “You must come and dine with me today,” he said to the Stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite.</p>
        <p>For dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment.
          The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly: Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.</p>

        <h1>The Crow and the Fox</h1>
        <p class="intro"></p>
        <p> Master Crow sat on a tree,
        Holding a cheese in his beak.
        Master Fox was attracted by the odour,
        And tried to attract him thus.
        "Mister Crow, good day to you.
        You are a handsome and good looking bird!
        In truth, if your song is as beautiful as your plumage,
        You are the Phoenix of this forest."
        Hearing these words the Crow felt great joy,
        And to demonstrate his beautiful voice,
        He opened his mouth wide and let drop his prey.
        The Fox seized it and said: "My good Sir,
        Know that every flatterer,
        Lives at the expense of those who take him seriously:
        This is a lesson that is worth a cheese no doubt."
        The Crow, embarrassed and confused,
        Swore, though somewhat later, that he would never be
        tricked thus again. </p>

        <h1>The Fox and the Goat</h1>
        <p class="intro">The moral of “The Fox and Goat” is the well-known “Look before you leap.”  “The Fox and the Goat” is an Æsopic fable, but La Fontaine has rearranged Æsop.</p>
        <p>Once a fox was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell into a well. He tried his level best to come out but all in vain. So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked, “what are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”
          The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and see for yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.
          Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then I shall help you come out too.” The goat was innocent enough to understand the shrewdness of the fox and did as the fox said and helped him get out of the well.
          While walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have got in without seeing how to get out.”
          Moral: Look before you leap.  Do not just blindly walk in to anything without thinking.</p>

        <h1>The Wolf, the Fox and the Ape</h1>
        <p class="intro"></p>
        <p>A Wolf charged a Fox with theft, which he denied, and the case was brought before an Ape to be tried. When he had heard the evidence on both sides, the Ape gave judgment as follows: "I do not think," he said, "that you, O Wolf, ever lost what you claim; but all the same I believe that you, Fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your denials."

        <h1>The Cock and the Fox</h1>
        <p>One bright evening as the sun was sinking on a glorious world a wise old Cock flew into a tree to roost. Before he composed himself to rest, he flapped his wings three times and crowed loudly. But just as he was about to put his head under his wing, his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox.
          "Have you heard the wonderful news?" cried the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner.
          "What news?" asked the Cock very calmly. But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox.
          "Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event."
          "How grand!" said the Cock. "I certainly am delighted at the news." But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off.
          "What is it you see?" asked the Fox a little anxiously.
          "Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way. They must have heard the good news and—"
          But the Fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run.
          "Wait," cried the Cock. "Why do you run? The Dogs are friends of yours now!"
          "Yes," answered the Fox. "But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almost forgotten about."
          The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.
          The trickster is easily tricked.
